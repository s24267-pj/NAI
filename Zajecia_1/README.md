# Odd or Even Game

## Gameplay Rules
- The game starts with a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
- Players take turns selecting a number that has not been chosen yet.
- After both players have made their selections in a round, the sum of the chosen numbers is calculated:

- If the sum is even, Player 2 (Even) scores a point.
- The game continues until all numbers from the list have been chosen.
- The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.
